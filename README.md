# TCP Chat Room
A local TCP-based chat server/client set-up. Future extensions could include some security, input sanitizing, and encryption.

I wanted a way to chat with my friends without needing a third-party app. So I wrote my own! Nothing fancy, but was fun to play with sockets. Made me feel like an old-school programmer.
## Use
This code will work on a local server. It can easily be repurposed for communicating throughout the world by substituting your public IP address in the server.py file. If your computer isn't directly connected to the router, you'll have to set up port forwarding. Here's a nice source that helped me understand what that means and how to do it: https://www.howtogeek.com/66214/how-to-forward-ports-on-your-router/. From what I understand, modern firewalls and safety protocols really don't advise opening up your computer to intruders this way, so be careful.
